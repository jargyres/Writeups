    <p>
        While working through <a href="https://doc.lagout.org/security/The%20Shellcoder%E2%80%99s%20Handbook.pdf">The Shellcoder's Handbook</a>, I found myself looking up many ways to get their examples working on my machine.<br><br>
        Here is a couple of settings and tips I found to make your life a little easier.

    <h1><u>Disabling ALSR</u></h1><br>
    <p>Address Space Layout Randomization (ALSR) is a memory-exploitation mitigation technique used on both Windows and Linux systems in order to prevent an attacker from reliably jumping to an area in memory, possibly to move execution to a exploited function</p><br>
    <p>The Linux PaX project first coined the term ALSR and implemented the first design of ALSR in 2001, as a patch for the Linux kernel</p><br>
    <p>The Linux kernel has included a form of ALSR by default since kernel version 2.6.12, released in 2005</p><br>
    <p>Read more about the internals of implementations of ALSR in a presentation titled: <a href="https://grsecurity.net/PaX-presentation.pdf">The Guaranteed End of Arbitrary Code Execution</a> by the PaX group.</p><br>
    <h3><u>Problems Arising with ALSR</u></h3><br>
    <p>In order to execute shellcode, we need to find out the starting address of our shellcode.</p><br>
    <p>There are several modern methods to find this information while running, such as a jump in the shellcode for relative positioning.</p><br>
    <p>For simple testing, we can simply grab the address of <strong>esp</strong>, the stack pointer, and guess our location.</p><br>
    <p>A simple C program given in <a href="https://doc.lagout.org/security/The%20Shellcoder%E2%80%99s%20Handbook.pdf">The Shellcoder's Handbook</a>, grabs the address of <strong>esp</strong>.</p><br>
    <pre><code>
    //find_start.c
    unsigned_long find_start(void){
            __asm__("movl %esp, %eax");
    }
    int main(){
        printf("0x%x\n", find_start());
    }
    </code></pre><br>
    <h3><u>On a ALSR enabled machine (default)</u></h3><br>
    <pre>
    <code>
    jta@desktop:~$ ./find_start
    0xffc7be40
    jta@desktop:~$ ./find_start
    0xffd8a930
    jta@desktop:~$ ./find_start
    0xfffc2c20
    jta@desktop:~$ ./find_start
    0xff838f00
    </code>
    </pre><br>
    <p>As you can see, ALSR is randomizing where our stack begins every time the program is run.</p><br>
    <p>There are a couple ways to disable ALSR</p><br>
    <h4><u>Disable ALSR Permanently</u></h4><br>
    <p>On Linux, ALSR is controlled using the <code>/proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space</code> interface.</p><br>
    <p>This interface supports the following values:</p><br>
    <pre>
    <code>
    0 – No randomization. Everything is static.
    1 – Conservative randomization. Shared libraries, stack, mmap(), VDSO, and heap are randomized.
    2 – Full randomization. In addition to elements listed in the previous point, memory managed through brk() is also randomized. (Default)
    </code>
    </pre><br>
    <p>To turn off ALSR, simply run the command:</p><br>
    <pre>
    <code>
    echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
    </code>
    </pre><br>
    <p>To enable it again run:</p>
    <pre>
    <code>
    echo 2 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
    </code>
    </pre><br>
    <p>To disable this permanently (not recommended), you'll have to configure sysctl:</p><br>
    <pre>
    <code>
    touch /etc/sysctl.d/01-disable-aslr.conf
    echo "kernel.randomize_va_space = 0" >> /etc/sysctl.d/01-disable-aslr.conf
    </code>
    </pre><br>
    <h4><u>Temporarily Disable ALSR (Recommended)</u></h4><br>
    <p>To temporarily disable ALSR, we can use the <strong>setarch</strong> command</p><br>
    <p><strong>setarch</strong> will change an architecture or personality flags in an environment.</p><br>
    <p>We want to use this with the <strong>-R</strong> flag:</p><br>
    <pre>
    <code>
    -R, --addr-no-randomize
        Disables randomization of the virtual address space. Turns on ADDR_NO_RANDOMIZE.
    </code>
    </pre><br>
    <p>Then we can simply open a new environment with out current architecture without address randomization using:</p><br>
    <pre>
    <code>
    setarch $(uname -m) -R /bin/bash
    </code>
    </pre><br>
    <h3><u>find_start without ALSR</u></h3><br>
    <pre>
    <code>
    jta@desktop:~$ setarch $(uname -m) -R /bin/bash
    jta@desktop:~$ ./find_start
    0xffffd1d0
    jta@desktop:~$ ./find_start
    0xffffd1d0
    jta@desktop:~$ ./find_start
    0xffffd1d0
    jta@desktop:~$ ./find_start
    0xffffd1d0
    </code>

    <a id="gccFlags"></a>
    <h1><u>GCC Flags</u></h1><br>
    <h3><u>32-Bit</u></h3><br>
    <p><a href="https://doc.lagout.org/security/The%20Shellcoder%E2%80%99s%20Handbook.pdf">The Shellcoder's Handbook</a> is written in 2007, and as such many of the examples are assuming a 32-bit system.</p><br>
    <p>In fact, many times shellcode is written assuming a 32-bit architecture, to maximize the portability from x86 and x86_64 systems.</p><br>
    <p>We want to compile our programs written in C using the 32-bit flag in gcc:</p><br>
    <pre>
    <code>
    -m32
    -m64
        Generate code for a 32-bit or 64-bit environment.  The 32-bit environment sets int, long and pointer to 32 bits.  The 64-bit environment
        sets int to 32 bits and long and pointer to 64 bits.
    </code>
    </pre><br>
    <p>We want to use the <code>-m32</code> option.</p><br>
    <h3><u>Executable Stack</u></h3><br>
    <p>Many uses of shellcode involve changing the program flow to pre-made shellcode, which can be stored on the stack</p><br>
    <p>Making the stack non-executable is a policy enforced in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%5EX">W^X</a>, a security feature that states that memory can either be writable or executable, but never both.</p><br>
    <p>Since we want to execute our own opcodes from the stack, we'll need to pass the option <code>execstack</code> to the linker <code>ld</code>, which is automatically called when invoking <code>gcc</code>:</p><br>
    <pre>
    <code>
    execstack
        Marks the object as requiring executable stack.
    </code>
    </pre><br>
    <p>We do this by passing the argument <code>-zexecstack</code> to <code>gcc</code></p><br>
    <h3><u>Disable Stack Smashing Detector</u></h3><br>
    <p>Since we are wanting to test buffer overflow exploits, we need to turn off the stack protector.</p><br>
    <p>This option is enabled as default <code>-fstack-protector-strong</code> in Ubuntu 14.10 and later versions.</p><br>
    <pre>
    <code>
    -fstack-protector
        Emit extra code to check for buffer overflows, such as stack smashing attacks.  This is done by adding a guard variable to functions with
        vulnerable objects.  This includes functions that call "alloca", and functions with buffers larger than or equal to 8 bytes.  The guards
        are initialized when a function is entered and then checked when the function exits.  If a guard check fails, an error message is printed
        and the program exits.  Only variables that are actually allocated on the stack are considered, optimized away variables or variables
        allocated in registers don't count.

    -fstack-protector-strong
        Like -fstack-protector but includes additional functions to be protected --- those that have local array definitions, or have references
        to local frame addresses.  Only variables that are actually allocated on the stack are considered, optimized away variables or variables
        allocated in registers don't count.
    </code>
    </pre><br>
    <p>We obviously don't want extra code to check for buffer overflows in every function, so we disable that with the option: <code>-fno-stack-protector</code></p><br>
    <h3><u>Align Stack</u></h3><br>
    <p>We want to make sure that our stack is aligned in dword increments. Setting this to 2 will also stop the machine from optimizing the stack.</p><br>
    <pre>
    <code>
    -mpreferred-stack-boundary=num
        Attempt to keep the stack boundary aligned to a 2 raised to num byte boundary.  If -mpreferred-stack-boundary is not specified, the
        default is 4 (16 bytes or 128-bits).

        Warning: If you use this switch, then you must build all modules with the same value, including any libraries.  This includes the system
        libraries and startup modules.
    </code>
    </pre><br>
    <p>To enable dword sized increments of stack layout, pass the option: <code>-mpreferred-stack-boundary=2</code></p><br>
    <h3><u>Disable Position Independent Executables and Code</u></h3><br>
    <p>By default, with ALSR enabled, the compiler and linker will make position independent code and link to position independent executables.</p><br>
    <p>This is not ideal in the case of testing simple shellcode, as the subroutines and executables we call will be randomized every time the program is run.</p><br>
    <p>By disabling PIE and PIC, we will be able to easily test shellcode by grabbing addresses of functions we want to call reliably.</p><br>
    <p>To disable, pass the arguments: <code>-no-pie -fno-pic</code></p><br>

    <a id="compilingShellcode"></a>
    <h1><u>Compiling Shellcode</u></h1><br>
    <p>When writing shellcode, we want to make sure that after we have the binary, that it does it's intended purpose before attempting to inject it into a vulnerable buffer.</p><br>
    <p>For example, the assembly given in the book for calling <code>execve()</code> to run <code>/bin/sh</code>:</p><br>
    <pre>
    <code>
    ; int execve(const char *filename, char *const argv[], char *const envp[]);
    ; needs 4 things
    ; eax to hold execve syscall 11 (0xb)
    ; ebx to hold address of string
    ; ecx to hold pointer of argument array
    ; edx to hold pointer of environment array, which will be null
    
    Section .text
    
        global _start
    
    _start:
    
        ; jump immediately to GoToCall
        ; the Call will store the address of the next instruction into esi
        jmp short GoToCall
    
    shellcode:
    
        ; pop the address of our string into esi
        pop esi
    
        ; fill eax with xor bytes
        xor eax, eax
    
        ; terminate our /bin/sh string by copying the last
        ; null byte of eax over the last byte of the string
        mov byte [esi+7], al
    
        ; put the address of the beginning of the string into ebx
        lea ebx, [esi]
    
        ; copy the value stored in ebx, now the address of the beginning of the string
        ; over the AAAA placeholders
        ; this is the argument pointer to the binary to be executed
        ; which execve needs
        mov long [esi+8], ebx
    
        ; copy the nulls still stored in eax over the KKKK placeholders
        mov long [esi+12], eax
    
        ; eax no longer needs to be null
        ; so copy the value for the execve syscall (0x0b) into al
        mov byte al, 0x0b
    
        ; load ebx with the address of our string
        mov ebx, esi
    
        ; load ecx with the pointer of our string
        lea ecx, [esi+8]
    
        ; load edx with the address of the value of KKKK, a pointer to null
        lea edx, [esi+12]
    
        ; execute int 0x80 to make the syscall
        int 0x80
    
    GoToCall:
    
        Call shellcode
    
        ; the address of this instruction will be put into esi after the call
        db '/bin/shJAAAAKKKK'
    </code>
    </pre><br>
    <p>We need to compile this as a 32-bit elf file, so to compile to an object with nasm:</p><br>
    <code>nasm -f elf32 execve.nasm</code><br><br>
    <p>Then to link the resulting <code>execve.o</code> object file to an executable binary, we need to use <code>ld</code>, the gnu linker.</p><br>
    <p>To actually run the resulting elf ourselves, we need to make sure that the data on the stack is executable and in the correct architecture:</p><br>
    <code>ld -m elf_i386 -z execstack -N -o execve execve.o</code><br><br>
    <p>Here we set many similar things as when we were compiling C code with gcc, the exception being that we need to set the <code>-N</code> argument, meaning that the text and data sections will be readable and writable, as well as disabling linking against shared libraries.</p><br>
    <pre>
    <code>
    -N
    --omagic
        Set the text and data sections to be readable and writable.  Also, do not page-align the data segment, and disable linking against shared
        libraries.  If the output format supports Unix style magic numbers, mark the output as "OMAGIC". Note: Although a writable text section is
        allowed for PE-COFF targets, it does not conform to the format specification published by Microsoft.
    </code>
